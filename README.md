# DCGAN
This is a **Deep Convolutional General Adversarial Network** built to produce images of numbers from **0 to 9**. These are trained from the **MNIST** dataset and our own datasets can also be used. (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) is used here to create this DCGAN and the progress is visualized through [**Tensorboard**](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started). 

You can also run this in [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), but place [**DCGAN_model.py**](https://github.com/Newbie-master-416/DCGAN/blob/main/DCGAN_model.py) file in the main folder of your Google Colab. The Hyperparameters are from the DCGAN paper [**Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).
